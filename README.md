# Username Generator and Factorial Generator
A program designed and created for the "Developing Software Introduction" module in HNC Computing.

This program was created for my final assessment for the HNC Computing Module - Developing Software Introduction. It is used to generate a username based on an inputted first and last name and can calculate a factorial. It showcases the skills I gained while learning Java in this class through a CLI application.
